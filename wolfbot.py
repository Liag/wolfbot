# IRC Bot to moderate a game of "Werewolf".
#
# Werewolf is a traditional party game, sometimes known as 'Mafia',
# with dozens of variants.  This bot is following Andrew Plotkin's rules:
# http://www.eblong.com/zarf/werewolf.html
#
# Code originally based on example bot and irc-bot class from
# Joel Rosdahl <joel@rosdahl.net>, author of included python-irclib.
#
# Several modifications by Victor "Liag" Radmark <victor@liag.se>

"""An IRC bot to moderate a game of "Werewolf".

This is an example bot that uses the SingleServerIRCBot class from
ircbot.py.  The bot enters a channel and listens for commands in
private messages and channel traffic.  Commands in channel messages
are given by prefixing the text by the bot name followed by a colon.
(Or by prefixing the command with '!', e.g. '!start'
or 'wolfbot: start')

The main commands are:

    start game -- start a new werewolf game.

    end game -- quit the current werewolf game (you must have started it)

    stats -- print information about state of game-in-progress.
